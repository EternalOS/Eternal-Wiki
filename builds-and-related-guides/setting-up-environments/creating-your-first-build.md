# ðŸ”§ Creating Your First Build!

{% hint style="info" %}
**Dev Tip : The More Core Your Machine has the faster you could complete this process... Also a higher RAM amount would also help!**
{% endhint %}

## Setting Up for Build

Only Once You Have Fully Completed the repo sync you might continue this step if you are not sure that the repo was fully synced run this command in your directory which has .repo folder :

```
repo status
```

if you see :

```
Up To Date (or something simillar)
```

you are good to go with the steps, if you see :

```
error not synced : xyz................
```

run the \`repo sync \[and all other stuff]\` command again; for other error check out online!
